# Homework 9: PWM Controller VHDL

## Overview
A Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal is shown below with varying pulse widths. You will be creating a
PWM controller that will be used in your final project to control an RGB LED.

For this image the period was set to 50ms, and the duty cycle was set as 50%. As seen in the image the cursor shows a period of 50ms, and a duty cycle of 50%.

For this image the period was again set to 50ms, but the duty cycle was set to 25%. 25% of 50ms is 125us. The cursor, due to resolution was not able to get exactly 125us.
